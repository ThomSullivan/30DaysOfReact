# 30DaysOfReact
Work done along with 30 Days of React
30 Days of Javascipt was such a good learning tool I decided to move right on into React.

## Day 1
Nothing new yet, but a good review of 30 days of JavaScript. It is nice to see that I am able to solve these problems with more alacrity than I had previously.

## Day 2 
Scaffolding a React app and working with JSX elements and babel. Writing JavaScript in babel reminds me of an ORM and it probably is something very similar. It was however explained that this method of using React is being shown only for the purpose of understanding how React works. Future days will utilize create-react-app.

## Day 3
First create-react-app boilerplate day! Most of the boilerplate was removed and JSX elements were used to create the page. Importing modules and files this way is a new way of working with files. Making a basic website from 95% JavaScript has never been easier! I eagerly await tomorrows challenge.

## Day 4
Work with React elements has started, creating function based elements that return JSX. Data is being injected into the JSX elements for various sources like object attributes, and random colors. Working with styles that are dependent upon variables within the function is a little tricky at the moment. However at this moment there is no CSS file and therefor CSS classes are not being utilized. At the moment styles are being defined as an object within the index.js file. I assume this will change as the days continue, but it is always nice to learn to methods to work around problems that are encountered.
