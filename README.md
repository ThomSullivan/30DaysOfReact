# 30DaysOfReact
Work done along with 30 Days of React
30 Days of Javascipt was such a good learning tool I decided to move right on into React.

Day 1
Nothing new yet, but a good review of 0 days of JavaScript. It is nice to see that I am able to solve these problems with more alacrity than I had previously.
